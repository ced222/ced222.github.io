          <p>In the novel Words on Bathroom Walls the author presents schizophrenia in a more positive light and shows some of the unique experiences schizophrenia can provide. Firstly, the author uses a simile to describe Adam’s hallucinations as “projections like a movie.” The readers often see movies as visual storylines and usually have a positive and relaxing connotation. By using the simile, it makes the reader think of the hallucinations almost as a wonderful experience instead of the terrifying image most people think of when they imagine these hallucinations. In addition, the word “projections'' emphasises the clarity of the “movie”, which based on previous context, draws the hallucinations in a positive way as more of a storyline with scenes than sporadic, unpleasant images. Drawing Adam’s hallucinations in a positive light also has the effect of softening up his image as a schizophrenic character. People with schizophrenia are often viewed as unpredictable and violent, therefore by going in depth and describing the hallucinations they receive as positive, it can make the reader think of people with schizophrenia more positively and as actual humans instead of inhuman and violent beasts.

          <p> It helps the reader see Adam as a mostly normal person instead of someone who is disabled and may affect their perspective of the story as they read the rest of the book. Thirdly, the author mentions how the positive hallucinations start when his “mind starts misbehaving” using juxtaposition. “Misbehaving” often has a negative connotation, whilst the hallucinations have been described in a positive light, showing how even when his brain starts doing negative things, the hallucinations that are projected can still be positive. This shows the reader how hallucinations that schizophrenic people experience are not always bad and can cause them to lash out. </p>
